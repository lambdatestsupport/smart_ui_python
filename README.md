## Smart UI Automation with Selenium Unit Test

### Description

This code is a Python script that demonstrates the use of Selenium WebDriver with the unit testing framework (unittest) to perform Smart UI automation tests on a website. It includes a sample test case that performs actions such as opening a webpage, taking Smart UI screenshots, and quitting the browser.

### Dependencies

- Selenium: The code requires the Selenium library to be installed. You can install it using the following command:

```shell
pip install selenium
```

### Usage

1. Make sure you have installed the necessary dependencies as mentioned above.

2. Update the code with your LambdaTest username and access key. Replace the placeholders in the following lines:

```python
username = "your_username_here"  # Replace with your LambdaTest username
access_key = "your_access_key_here"  # Replace with your LambdaTest access key
```

3. Update the desired capabilities in the `setUp` method to match your test requirements. You can customize the browser, version, platform, resolution, and other settings. Additionally, provide the project name in the `"smartUI.project"` capability.

4. Modify the test case method `test_unit_user_should_able_to_add_item` to write your own test case logic. You can add assertions, interact with the website, and perform any necessary actions for your specific test scenario.

5. Run the script using the following command:

```shell
python script.py
```

### Note

- The script uses the LambdaTest Selenium grid to execute the tests on remote browsers. Make sure you have a valid LambdaTest account and provide the correct username and access key.

- The code includes sample code to take Smart UI screenshots using LambdaTest's Smart UI feature. You can modify or remove this code based on your requirements.

- It's important to call `driver.quit()` in the `tearDown` method to close the browser and release system resources.
